	<p>Configuration for a connection to an SSH Server.</p>

	<p>This configuration will create a sinle connection to an SSH server which can then
	be used by <code>SSHTun In</code>, <code>SSHTun Out</code> and <code>SSHTun Req</code>
	nodes.</p>

	<p>The node will open a SSH control connection that will be used to tunnel all the 
	streams of data through.</p>

	<h4>Host & Port</h4>
	<p>This is the host/ip and the Port to which to authenticate with.</p>

	<h4>Private Key Authentication</h4>
	<p>A key file can be uploaded which will be used during the private key exchange
	authentication process. If left blank this process will be ignored and account
	authentication will need to be used. A field for a passphrase can be used if the 
	key file provided has been password protected.</p>

	<h4>Account Authentication</h4>
	<p>The account authentication is used to provide username or password for the
	remote user account that will be used to login. If left blank the private key
	authentication will need to be used.</p>

	<h4>Enable connection keep-alive</h4>
	<p>When enabled the SSH-level keep-alive messages will be sent to the server/host.
	The <b>interval</b> will be used to determine how often to send these messages.
	While the <b>max count</b> will determine how many unanswered messages are sent
	before the connection is terminated.</p>
