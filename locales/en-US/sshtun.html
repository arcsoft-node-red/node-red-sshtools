	<p>A SSH Tunnel in node provides a choice of inputs. Can either connect to a remote 
	TCP port, or accept incoming connections.</p>

	<p>The output type can be a single message or a stream of data. When the single message 
        is selected the node will wait for the client to disconnect before sending the message.</p>

	<p>The output types can be a Buffer, String, or Base64 string. This will be what the
        payload will be encoded as.</p>

	<p>Details of about the client will be added as properties of the message.</p>

	<p><b>Note: </b>On some systems you may need root or administorator access to ports
	below 1024. Also some SSH servers will only allow binding reverse tunnels to 
	localhost interfaces<p>

	<p>A SSH Tunnel out node provides a choice of outputs. Can either connect to a remote

	<p>Only the <code>msg.payload</code> is sent.</p>

	<p>If <code>msg.payload</code> is a string containing Base64 encoding of binary data,
	the Base64 decoding option will cause it to be converted back to binary before being
	sent.</p>

	<p>If <code>msg._session</code> is not present the payload is sent to <b>all</b>
	connected streams under the control of the SSH Configuration Node (<code>ssh-conncfg</code>)</p>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="sshtun-req">
	<p>A SSH Tunnel request node - sends the <code>msg.payload</code> to a
	server tcp port and expects a response.</p>

	<h3>Inputs</h3>
	<dl class="message-properties">
		<dt>payload <span class="property-type">string | buffer</span></dt>
		<dd>The data send as part of the request.</dd>
		<dt class="optional">host <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
		<dd>The hostname or IP address of the remote host to send the request.</dd>
		<dt class="optional">port <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
		<dd>The port of the remote host to send the request.</dd>
		<dt class="optional">disconnect <span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
		<dd>A flag to tell the node to disconnect after sending payload.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
        <p>Connects, sends the "request", and reads the "response". It can either 
        count a number of returned characters into a fixed buffer, match a specified 
        character before returning, wait a fixed timeout from first reply and then 
        return, sit and wait for data, or send then close the connection immediately, 
        without waiting for a reply.</p>
        
        <p>The response will be output in <code>msg.payload</code> as a buffer, so 
        you may want to .toString() it.</p>
        
        <p>If you leave remote host or port blank they must be set by using the 
        <code>msg.host</code> and <code>msg.port</code> properties in every message 
        sent to the node.</p>
